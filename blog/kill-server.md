**Title: Managing Development Server Processes with Bash Scripting**

**Description:**
In a typical development environment, it's common to run multiple servers simultaneously. However, managing these server processes manually can be cumbersome and time-consuming. In this blog post, we'll explore how to simplify the management of development server processes using a Bash script. By automating tasks such as listing processes by port and killing them if necessary, developers can streamline their workflow and focus more on coding.

**Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to list processes by port
list_processes_by_port() {
    local port=$1
    lsof -i :$port
}

# Function to kill a process by PID
kill_process_by_pid() {
    local pid=$1
    kill -9 $pid
}

# List processes for common development server ports
echo "List of processes for common development server ports:"

# Define an array of common development server ports
common_ports=(8080 3000 3001)

# Loop through the array and list processes for each port
for port in "${common_ports[@]}"; do
    list_processes_by_port $port
done

# Prompt the user for the port to kill
read -p "Enter the port number of the development server to kill: " port_to_kill

# Get the PID associated with the specified port
pid_to_kill=$(lsof -ti :$port_to_kill)

# Check if a process is using the specified port
if [ -n "$pid_to_kill" ]; then
    # Kill the process
    kill_process_by_pid $pid_to_kill
    echo "Process with PID $pid_to_kill for port $port_to_kill killed successfully."
else
    echo "Error: No process found for port $port_to_kill."
fi
```

**Explanation:**

1. The script defines two functions: `list_processes_by_port` to list processes using a specified port, and `kill_process_by_pid` to kill a process by its PID.
2. It lists processes for common development server ports (e.g., 8080, 3000, 3001) using the `list_processes_by_port` function.
3. It prompts the user to enter the port number of the development server they want to kill.
4. It retrieves the PID associated with the specified port using `lsof`.
5. If a process is found for the specified port, it kills the process using `kill_process_by_pid`.
6. It provides appropriate feedback based on whether the process was successfully killed or not.

**Conclusion:**
By using a Bash script to manage development server processes, developers can streamline their workflow and save time. This automation simplifies the process of identifying and terminating server processes, improving efficiency and productivity. Feel free to customize the script to fit your specific development environment and enjoy a smoother development experience.

That wraps up our guide on managing development server processes with Bash scripting. Happy coding and automating!
